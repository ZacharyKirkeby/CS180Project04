# Part 1

## Project Overview

Our group selected Option 3 for our specific implementation of Project 4. Since our group has 5 members, we included all
three selection options. 

From a high level, our project is composed of 6 classes, which implement all core requirements as well as selective
requirements. 

### Account



### Customer

### MarketPlace

### Product

### Seller

### Store

The store class handles the creation of the Store object. A Store object contains an arraylist of Products,
seller name, seller location, and the store name. 

The store keeps track of purchases, can return product options, and hosts the sorting methods on a store
by store basis.
